/*
 * The restartable sequences mechanism is the overlap of two distinct
 * restart mechanisms: a sequence counter tracking preemption and signal
 * delivery for high-level code, and an ip-fixup-based mechanism for the
 * final assembly instruction sequence.
 *
 * A high-level summary of the algorithm to use rseq from user-space is
 * as follows:
 *
 * The high-level code between rseq_start() and rseq_finish() loads the
 * current value of the sequence counter in rseq_start(), and then it
 * gets compared with the new current value within the rseq_finish()
 * restartable instruction sequence. Between rseq_start() and
 * rseq_finish(), the high-level code can perform operations that do not
 * have side-effects, such as getting the current CPU number, and
 * loading from variables.
 *
 * Stores are performed at the very end of the restartable sequence 
 * assembly block. Each assembly block within rseq_finish() defines a
 * "struct rseq_cs" structure which describes the start_ip and
 * post_commit_ip addresses, as well as the abort_ip address where the
 * kernel should move the thread instruction pointer if a rseq critical
 * section assembly block is preempted or if a signal is delivered on
 * top of a rseq critical section assembly block.
 *
 * Detailed algorithm of rseq use:
 *
 * rseq_start()
 *
 *   0. Userspace loads the current event counter value from the
 *      event_counter field of the registered struct rseq TLS area,
 *
 * rseq_finish()
 *
 *   Steps [1]-[3] (inclusive) need to be a sequence of instructions in
 *   userspace that can handle being moved to the abort_ip between any
 *   of those instructions.
 *
 *   The abort_ip address needs to be less than start_ip, or
 *   greater-or-equal the post_commit_ip. Step [4] and the failure
 *   code step [F1] need to be at addresses lesser than start_ip, or
 *   greater-or-equal the post_commit_ip.
 *
 *       [start_ip]
 *   1.  Userspace stores the address of the struct rseq_cs assembly
 *       block descriptor into the rseq_cs field of the registered
 *       struct rseq TLS area. This update is performed through a single
 *       store, followed by a compiler barrier which prevents the
 *       compiler from moving following loads or stores before this
 *       store.
 *
 *   2.  Userspace tests to see whether the current event counter value
 *       match the value loaded at [0]. Manually jumping to [F1] in case
 *       of a mismatch.
 *
 *       Note that if we are preempted or interrupted by a signal
 *       after [1] and before post_commit_ip, then the kernel also
 *       performs the comparison performed in [2], and conditionally
 *       clears the rseq_cs field of struct rseq, then jumps us to
 *       abort_ip.
 *
 *   3.  Userspace critical section final instruction before
 *       post_commit_ip is the commit. The critical section is
 *       self-terminating.
 *       [post_commit_ip]
 *
 *   4.  Userspace clears the rseq_cs field of the struct rseq
 *       TLS area.
 *
 *   5.  Return true.
 *
 *   On failure at [2]:
 *
 *   F1. Userspace clears the rseq_cs field of the struct rseq
 *       TLS area. Followed by step [F2].
 *
 *       [abort_ip]
 *   F2. Return false.

/*
 * The rseq_event_counter allow user-space to detect preemption and
 * signal delivery. It increments at least once before returning to
 * user-space if a thread is preempted or has a signal delivered. It is
 * not meant to be an exact counter of such events.
 *
 * Overflow of the event counter is not a problem in practice. It
 * increments at most once between each user-space thread instruction
 * executed, so we would need a thread to execute 2^32 instructions or
 * more between rseq_start() and rseq_finish(), while single-stepping,
 * for this to be an issue.
 *
 * On 64-bit architectures, both cpu_id and event_counter can be updated
 * with a single 64-bit store. On 32-bit architectures, __put_user() is
 * expected to perform two 32-bit single-copy stores to guarantee
 * single-copy atomicity semantics for other threads.
